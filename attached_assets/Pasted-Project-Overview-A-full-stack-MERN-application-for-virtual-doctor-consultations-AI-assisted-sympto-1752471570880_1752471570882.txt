Project Overview

A full-stack MERN application for virtual doctor consultations, AI-assisted symptom analysis, and secure health record management. The platform enables patients to book appointments, consult via video calls, track symptoms, and securely store health records, with a focus on user-friendly design and privacy.

Tech Stack





Frontend: React.js (responsive UI with Tailwind CSS)



Backend: Node.js, Express.js (REST APIs)



Database: MongoDB (store patient data, appointments, and health records)



AI Integration: Infermedica API or custom Python-based NLP model for symptom analysis



Video Calls: WebRTC (via Agora or PeerJS)



Authentication: JWT for secure user sessions



Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Render (backend), MongoDB Atlas (database)

Key Features





User Authentication: Secure login/signup for patients and doctors.



Appointment Booking: Patients can browse doctor profiles and book video consultations.



AI Symptom Checker: AI analyzes symptoms entered by patients to suggest possible conditions.



Video Consultations: Real-time video calls using WebRTC.



Health Record Management: Secure storage and retrieval of medical history with encryption.



Wellness Tracker: Monitor vitals (e.g., heart rate, sleep) with progress charts.

Implementation Plan

1. Project Setup





Initialize a MERN stack project with separate folders for frontend (client) and backend (server).



Install dependencies: create-react-app for frontend, express, mongoose, jsonwebtoken for backend.



Set up MongoDB Atlas for cloud database hosting.

2. Backend (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB)





Models: Create MongoDB schemas for User (patient/doctor), Appointment, and HealthRecord.



APIs:





POST /api/auth/register: User signup with password hashing (bcrypt).



POST /api/auth/login: JWT-based login.



POST /api/appointments: Book an appointment.



GET /api/appointments/:userId: Fetch user appointments.



POST /api/symptoms: Send symptoms to AI API for analysis.



POST /api/health-records: Store encrypted health records.



AI Integration: Use Infermedica API for symptom checking or a Python Flask microservice with a pre-trained NLP model (e.g., Hugging Face).



Security: Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., health records) using crypto module in Node.js.

3. Frontend (React)





Components:





Auth: Login/signup forms.



Dashboard: Patient/doctor dashboard with appointment and record views.



SymptomChecker: Form to input symptoms and display AI results.



VideoCall: WebRTC-based video consultation interface.



Styling: Use Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern UI.



State Management: React Context or Redux for user sessions and appointments.

4. AI Symptom Checker





Use Infermedica API for quick integration or a custom Python model (e.g., BERT-based classifier) hosted as a microservice.



Example API call:

const response = await axios.post('https://api.infermedica.com/v3/parse', {
  text: 'I have a headache and fever',
}, { headers: { 'App-Id': 'YOUR_ID', 'App-Key': 'YOUR_KEY' } });



Display suggested conditions and recommendations on the frontend.

5. Video Calls





Integrate WebRTC via PeerJS or Agora SDK for peer-to-peer video calls.



Example: Set up a simple PeerJS call in React:

import Peer from 'peerjs';
const peer = new Peer();
peer.on('call', (call) => {
  navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true }).then((stream) => {
    call.answer(stream);
  });
});

6. Deployment





Deploy frontend on Vercel: Push React code to GitHub and connect to Vercel.



Deploy backend on Render: Set up Node.js environment and link to MongoDB Atlas.



Test APIs with Postman before frontend integration.

Sample Code: Appointment Booking API

Below is a sample backend code for creating and fetching appointments.

server/models/Appointment.js

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const appointmentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  patientId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  doctorId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  date: { type: Date, required: true },
  time: { type: String, required: true },
  status: { type: String, enum: ['pending', 'confirmed', 'completed'], default: 'pending' },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Appointment', appointmentSchema);

server/routes/appointments.js

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const Appointment = require('../models/Appointment');
const auth = require('../middleware/auth');

// Book an appointment
router.post('/', auth, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { patientId, doctorId, date, time } = req.body;
    const appointment = new Appointment({ patientId, doctorId, date, time });
    await appointment.save();
    res.status(201).json(appointment);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error' });
  }
});

// Get user appointments
router.get('/:userId', auth, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const appointments = await Appointment.find({
      $or: [{ patientId: req.params.userId }, { doctorId: req.params.userId }],
    }).populate('patientId doctorId');
    res.json(appointments);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error' });
  }
});

module.exports = router;

Next Steps





GitHub Setup: Create a repo and structure it with client and server folders. Use .gitignore for node_modules and .env.



AI Exploration: Sign up for Infermedica API or experiment with Hugging Face models in Python.



Testing: Use Jest for backend unit tests and Cypress for frontend E2E tests.



Portfolio: Deploy the app live, document it in your GitHub README, and showcase it in hackathons or job applications.
